<h1>Forms V1.0</h1>

Forms is a Tool to ease creation of form templates and ease filling those templates

<h2>Forms goals are:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Human focused, within a human organization everyone is capable of doing a request on behalf of himself or on behalf of others, errors can happen, but is better to have those errors fast so those that made them can learn and so they can be also fast fixed.</li>
<li>Simple, will be focused on just a small set of features</li>
<li>Flexible, allows evolution of templates, provides means to avoid duplication of work. Since templates are loosly coupled, Forms invites your organizations to have conventions, but they are not forced more that the template definition itself</li>
<li>Fast, current large organizations involve having certain people to do certain things, whilst that can hold reasonable for certain workflows, it is more reasonable that if at any time anyone can make things progress</li>
</ul>

<h2>So that means that EVERYONE IS TREATED EQUAL WITHIN THE TOOL.</h2>

<ul>
<li>Every user within the organization has the same level of privileges, so everyone can fix whatever error are detected, DO NOT WAIT for approval to do so, just do it.</li>
<li>Every action (create, modify or delete) is tracked</li>
<li>Every action can be undone</li>
<li>As a form filler you will only have to select the template and then fill as many forms as needed</li>
<li>As a form processor you will only have to select the relevant template and filter those relevant to you</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use Forms for:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Forms used a lot by your organization which involve small "literature" on them</li>
<li>Structured Information that needs to be shared and available to the rest of your organization</li>
<li>Hide complex workflows</li> 
</ul>

<h2>DO NOT use Forms for:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Substitute talking</li>
<li>Personal information</li>
<li>Private or protected information</li>
<li>Substitute Tools being properlly used.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Referee:</h2>

<ul>
<li>The person that installs Forms is the Forms Referee</li>
<li>Forms Referee can delete data so it is not visible in templates/forms or audits. This can be used in case someone sets Personal, Private or Protected information</li>
<li>Forms Referee can reject the creation of a particular Template, if it is considered repeated, or too complex or unneeded</li>
</ul>
